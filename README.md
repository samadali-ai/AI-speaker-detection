# AI-Based Speaker Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a system that can detect and identify different speakers in an audio file. The process involves transcribing the audio content and then associating each segment of the transcription with the correct speaker. The system is built using two key components:

1. **WhisperX**: An advanced version of OpenAI's Whisper, optimized for faster and more accurate transcription with speaker labels.
2. **Speaker Diarization Models**: These models are used to identify and segment different speakers in the audio. Diarization is the process of partitioning an audio stream into homogeneous segments according to the speaker identity.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Transcription**: The project uses WhisperX to provide highly accurate transcription of the audio content. The model is capable of handling various languages and accents, making it robust for different types of audio inputs.
  
- **Speaker Diarization**: The diarization models, such as those provided by the `pyannote.audio` library, can distinguish between different speakers in the audio. This helps in segmenting the audio based on who is speaking at any given time.

- **Speaker Assignment**: By combining the outputs of transcription and diarization, the system can assign speaker labels to each segment of the transcribed text. This results in a text output where each line or segment of dialogue is tagged with the identity of the speaker.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.10 or higher**: The project is implemented in Python, so you'll need an appropriate version of Python installed on your machine.

- **Libraries and Packages**:
  - **WhisperX**: For transcription. WhisperX is an enhanced version of Whisper, optimized for performance.
  - **pyannote.audio**: For speaker diarization. This library provides pre-trained models that can be used to identify and separate different speakers in an audio file.
  - **Torch**: As a backend for deep learning models used in both transcription and diarization tasks.
  - **Additional Libraries**: Libraries like `numpy` and `librosa` are used for various data processing tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Transcription with WhisperX**:
   - The audio file is fed into the WhisperX model, which processes the audio and converts it into text. The model also provides timestamps for each segment of the transcription, allowing for precise tracking of when each word or sentence was spoken.

2. **Speaker Diarization**:
   - The diarization model processes the same audio file to identify and segment the speech based on the speaker. The result is a series of time-stamped segments, each associated with a different speaker label (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.).

3. **Combining Transcription and Diarization**:
   - The transcription and diarization outputs are combined to assign speaker labels to each segment of text. This involves matching the timestamps from the transcription with those from the diarization output to determine which speaker was speaking at each point in the transcription.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output is a text file or printed output where each line of transcription is tagged with the corresponding speaker. For example:
     - `Speaker 1: Hello, everyone.`
     - `Speaker 2: Hi! How are you?`
   - This allows for easy identification of who said what in the audio.

## Example Use Cases

- **Meeting Transcriptions**: Automatically transcribe and identify speakers in recorded meetings, making it easier to track contributions from different participants.
- **Podcast Transcriptions**: Generate transcripts of podcasts with clear indications of who is speaking at any given time.
- **Interview Analysis**: Analyze recorded interviews by segmenting and labeling responses from different interviewees.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Main Script**: The primary script that handles the transcription and diarization process.
- **README.md**: This documentation file, which provides an overview of the project.
- **Dependencies**: A list of required Python packages and libraries that need to be installed for the project to run.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project on your local machine, you need to install the required Python packages using a package manager like `pip`. This will include WhisperX, pyannote.audio, and other dependencies.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Contributions in the form of bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the documentation are always welcome.
